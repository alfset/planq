# IBC Staking



## Understanding IBC Staking:

IBC staking involves delegating cryptocurrency assets to validators across different blockchain networks connected through the IBC protocol. Stakers lock their tokens in the staking process, contributing to the security and consensus mechanism of the blockchain network. In return, stakers earn rewards for their participation, creating an incentive-driven system that promotes network security, decentralization, and participation.
